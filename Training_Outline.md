Recommended training: GitHub Copilot and its features
Training should focus on building practical knowledge of GitHub Copilot, covering the following areas

Code assistance, Agents, and the AI models.

Use cases:
Developing a new application using agents, including its pros and cons.
Adding new features to the existing code
Performing code reviews (PR’s)
Optimization of existing code
Writing effective prompts and applying best techniques.

Details on the Program:

Audience: Developers and Automation testers, strong and hold on version control tools (Github/ GitLab/ CodeCommit/ TFVC)

Outcomes: Developers and automation testers will level up and speed up the development and recuing the deliverables timelines.

Here are a few pointers: 
Start with a business problem based on real world projects.
Have thought provoking questions which will trigger the thoughts of students for solving this business problem and they must be related to topics we are teaching. Click on the question for the answer to show up. 
On every slide let us have the interesting latest insight with some statistics from trusted source. 
After every slide we need one MCQ and again with one interesting insight. 
This must be followed by hands-on demonstration and clear note that participants cannot do it in parallel and if they do it they will miss out on key things. We shall give LMS access for recorded modules for 30 days. 
Create such an HTML file for all 5 days by using color palette of AiSPRY logo.
